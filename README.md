FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

In my full stack project, I utilized several frontend technologies, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture. These technologies played a crucial role in shaping the dynamic nature of the web application. 

With Express HTML and EJS(Embedded JavaScript) templating engine I was able to generate HTML dynamically on the server-side. My approach allowed me to render HTML pages with real-time data pulled from the backend, enabling a seamless experience for the user.

JavaScript played a big role in the development process, particularly for adding interactivity to the web pages. It allowed me to handle user input, manage events, and update the user interface.

Developing the app as a SPA allowed me to create a highly dynamic web application. By using JavaScript the page loads only once and then interacts with the backend through API calls to fetch data. This made the app fast and responsive, with minimal reloads and improving overall user experience. 

I used MongoDB (NoSQL Database) for the backend because of its flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with Javascript. MongoDB uses a document-oriented structure with JSON-like data, which aligns well with JavaScript and JSON. This made it easier to stor retrieve, and manage data in a format thats compatible with the frontend, particularly for complex or evolving data structures. Additionally, MongoDBs ability to handle large datasets and scale horizontally makes it an ideal choice for modern web applications with high traffic demands. 

JSON VS. JAVASCRIPT AND HOW THEY CONNECTED MY FRONTEND AND BACKEND

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for exchanging data between a server and client. While JavaScript is a programming language that enables functionality on the client side and interacts with data, JSON is purely a data format. In my project, JSON serves as the intermediary between the frontend and backend. Data is transmitted from the backend as JSON, and the frontend parses this data to display updated, dynamic content. 

HOW THE COURSE HELPED ME ACHIEVE MY PROFESSIONAL GOALS 

The amount of information and knowledge that I've gained in this course is overwhelming. On a technical level I've learned alot about the full stack development and the different approaches that one can take to develop a functioning webpage. I've improved my problem-solving skills, programming skills and methodologies. 

This course has helped advance my skill and prepared me for a career in web development. The hands-on experience with full stack technologies has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend development. Ive learned key skills in problem-solving, programming, and system design, all of which are critical for building robuts web applications. 

In particular, I have developed expertise in full stack development, including mastering technologies like Express.js, MondoDB, and JavaScript frameworks. I believe these skills are highly sought after in the industry and have made me a more marketable canitdate in the tech field. 

Lastly, the course has enhanced my ability to work in an agile environment, emphasizing the importance of writing clean, maintainable code, testing thoroughly, and continuously improving my work.
