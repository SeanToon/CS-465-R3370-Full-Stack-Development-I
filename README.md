Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

Some of the different fronend technologies that were used in our full stack project include Express HTML, JavaScript and single-page application(SPA). Express HTML is and engine that allowed me to generate HTML on the server side. It allowed me to develop HTML pages with data from the backend. JavaScript was a big part of my development because it enabled interactivity on web pages. Developing a SPA made the webpage more dynamic because of the ability for SPA to handle highly interactive and fast responding user interfaces. Using a NoSQL MongoDB database gave the webpage more flexibility with structure, scalability because of its ability to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads and allowed for the developer to be more productive because of its alignment with JSON format. 

How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is different from JavaScript in the way that JSON is a data format that is used for transmitting data between different systems and JavaScript is a basic programming language used for implementing logic and functionality. To improve functionality and effeciency, I refactored code frequently. By refactoring code and reusing UI components I was able to improve maintainability. 

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
The amount of information and knowledge that I've gained in this course is overwhelming. On a technical level I've learned alot about the full stack development and the different approaches that one can take to develop a functioning webpage. I've improved my problem-solving skills, programming skills and methodologies.
